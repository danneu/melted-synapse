-- FIXME: Messy
--
-- I ended up combining ChampDetail and WaypointDetail into this module
-- after changing the system to allow Champs to have actions enqueued on them.
-- Couldn't think of a nice way to avoid duplicate logic for managing
-- actions in ChampDetail vs WaypointDetail, so I changed this module's
-- Module to accept a (Maybe Waypoint) so this module could be overloaded
-- to support Champ selection.
